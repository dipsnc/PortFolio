## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

To make this portfolio your own, you'll need to modify the content within the `index.html` file.

### 1. Personal Content

Replace the placeholder text with your actual information:

* **Navigation:** Update `<span class="gradient-text">Name.Dev</span>` with your name or brand.
* **Hero Section:** Replace the name in `Hi, I'm <span class="gradient-text">Name</span>` and the introductory subtitle.
* **About Section:** Update the descriptive paragraph.
* **Resume Link:** Update the `href` attribute for the "Download Resume" button.
* **Project Links:** Replace the `#` placeholders with actual links for the **Code** and **Demo** buttons.
* **Contact Section:** Update the `mailto:` link and social icon links.

### 2. Skills Section

The skill bars are powered by an inline `style` attribute.

To change a skill level, find the relevant `div` and modify the **`style="width: XX%"`** property:

```html
<div class="h-2 rounded-full bg-gray-200 dark:bg-white/10">
    <div
        class="h-2 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-400 to-blue-400"
        style="width: 95%"
    ></div>
</div>
```
